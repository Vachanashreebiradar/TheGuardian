Russia is backing east-west fragmentation in Bosnia. </p> <p>Where Britain stands in all this is dangerously unclear, drifting on a sea of Boris Johnsonâ€™s gestures and platitudes. The Royal Navy currently has a Â£3.2bn aircraft carrier waving the union flag in the South China Sea, completely unprotected. China could sink it in an hour. In the Black Sea, a British destroyer provocatively invades Russian waters off Crimea, showing off to the worldâ€™s media. Last week, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, advanced her bid for her partyâ€™s leadership by sitting astride a tank in Estonia and <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/russia-foreign-secretary-richard-moore-nato-vladimir-putin-b969136.html\">warning Russia</a> that Britain â€œstood firmâ€ against its â€œmalign activityâ€ in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Britainâ€™s outgoing defence chief, Sir Nick Carter, estimates that the risk of accidental war with Russia is now â€œthe <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/west-risk-conflict-with-russia-britains-army-chief-says-2021-11-13/\">highest in decades</a>â€.</p> <p>There is no evidence of a coherent strategy in these moves. Johnson is travelling a familiar path, seeking foreign glory to distract from domestic woes. He has announced a reversal of Britainâ€™s 1960s withdrawal from â€œ<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-speech-britain-is-back-east-of-suez\">east of Suez</a>â€. He seeks something called an â€œ<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/mar/15/why-britain-is-tilting-to-the-indo-pacific-region\">Indo-Pacific tilt</a>â€, and a projection of what he calls â€œBritish leadership in the worldâ€. His March defence review <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/15/cap-on-trident-nuclear-warhead-stockpile-to-rise-by-more-than-40\">proposed a 40% increase</a> in Britainâ€™s nuclear stockpile, in flagrant defiance of the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty. To push home the point, he appointed the navyâ€™s expansionist Admiral Tony Radakin as his new chief of defence staff, reportedly against military advice.</p> <p>What this has to do with Britainâ€™s defence is obscure. None of it falls within any treaty obligation. London has no obligation to get involved in Chinaâ€™s argument with Taiwan, nor does Taiwan even want it. Yet when Theresa May last month asked Johnson if his anti-Chinese Aukus treaty with Australia and America committed Britain to military action, Johnson played macho and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/16/theresa-may-aukus-pact-war-uk-china-taiwan\">refused to answer</a>.</p> <p>Nor has Britain any obligation to defend Ukraine, which is not a member of Nato. Yet Truss appears to suggest otherwise. As for Iran, Brexit ended Britainâ€™s need to impose crippling â€“ and useless â€“ economic sanctions. Yet it continues with them, even using them to refuse to ransom the imprisoned Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Most extraordinary, Johnson appears personally to have rescinded a pledge that Britain would never be the first to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/britain-could-respond-to-future-cyberattack-with-nuclear-strike-3xp9bq688\">use a nuclear weapon</a> in any future conflict. What conceivable credibility can be attached to such a threat?</p> <p>None of these bellicose emanations from the prime minister has anything to do with British security. They are play-acting. Britain is at liberty to say what it thinks about the authoritarian regimes in Russia and China â€“ indeed it has a moral duty to do so, as it has to accept refugees and extend aid to the needy. Such duties have nothing to do with defence. Yet Johnsonâ€™s ambiguous words and actions carry implications. Casual promises to confront and act, not stand idly by, can be misread and lead to no less casual commitments to deploy violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/01/us-warns-russia-plans-large-scale-attack-on-ukraine\">US warns Russia has plans for â€˜large scaleâ€™ attack on Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just such a morass of bombastic threats and counter-threats were hurled into the fury of instabilities that preceded the first world war. It was a similar bout of sabre-rattling that led the great powers to the nuclear cliff-edge during the Cuban crisis of 1962, and the Andropov miscalculation of 1983. Recent analyses of both have shown how <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/05/the-ussr-and-us-came-closer-to-nuclear-war-than-we-thought/276290\">truly close was disaster</a>, saved only by the luck of having sane leaders at the time. There is no such guarantee today. </p> <p>We can all see that the world faces dictatorships in Beijing and Moscow. Both are flexing their muscles internally and doing externally what both Britain and America did in their imperial prime, which is expand their influence. They see the westâ€™s global confidence dwindling. Democracy is sick, with America in turmoil and Europe dis-uniting. Neither Russia not China actually threatens the west, but both want to strengthen their spheres of control over their neighbours as powerful states have always done. Chinaâ€™s â€œbelt and roadâ€ strategy is a reprise of Britainâ€™s imperial preference.</p> <p>If any lesson is to be learned from recent decades, it is that the western powers are ill-advised to meddle in the power structures of China, India and the Middle East. They are not good policemen. They should accept that their role is to exemplify their much-vaunted western values at home, not force them on other nations and cultures in the manner of medieval crusaders. This merely condemns them to humiliation and their victims to the devastations of groups such as Islamic State and the Taliban.</p> <p>At this moment the world most needs wise and calm statesmanship. On leaving Afghanistan, Joe Biden at least had the dignity to learn the obvious lesson. It was over. Withdrawal should mark â€œthe end of an era of major military operations to remake other countriesâ€, as Biden put it. Other countries should be left to their own devices.</p> <p>No such lesson has come from Britain. All Johnson can do is boast that he is the ruler of a â€œglobal Britainâ€, and spend a fortune on useless weaponry. Can we imagine a German or French leader indulging in such imperialist bombast? In doing so he risks sucking his country into yet more murderous interventions. They can have nothing to do with his nationâ€™s security. They are political vanity.</p> <ul> <li><p>Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist<br></p></li> </ul>",

In court statements, Austin says that troops and weapons are still being deployed in â€œmilitary operations against al-Qaida and associated forces â€¦ throughout the Middle East and Africaâ€.</p> <p>Zubaydahâ€™s lawyers insist that the new emphasis on al-Qaida as the justification for keeping him in GuantÃ¡namo is also based on legal chicanery. Al-Qaida, they point out, was never specifically mentioned in the AUMF under which Zubaydah is being detained.</p> <p>They also highlight the fact that all the top al-Qaida leaders involved in 9/11, including Osama bin Laden himself, have either been killed or captured with the sole exception of Bin Ladenâ€™s successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/11/17/the-death-of-ayman-al-zawahri-and-the-future-of-al-qaida/\">some suggest</a> has died of illness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c9b9908946abc6be116b5a0c40d77f8493991bef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9b9908946abc6be116b5a0c40d77f8493991bef/9_0_320_400/320.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Zubaydah.\" width=\"320\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu Zubaydah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>â€œThey are saying that if thereâ€™s conflict with al-Qaida anywhere in the world, in Africa or elsewhere, then the war continues and GuantÃ¡namo detainees will be locked up forever,â€ the lead lawyer in Zubaydahâ€™s habeas petition, Mark Denbeaux, told the Guardian. â€œThat means that detention without trial, without hearings or justification, with detainees held in isolation and no access to the public or their families â€“ all that will never end.â€</p> <p>Denbeaux added: â€œThe war is over. How can you detain enemy combatants when thereâ€™s no combat going on?â€</p> <p>Denbeaux described the Zubaydah case as â€œthe perfect storm that exposed the evil behavior driving the global war on terror and the torture program in particularâ€. Zubaydah, a Palestinian aged 50 whose name at birth was Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, was the first terror suspect to be captured by the CIA months after 9/11.</p> <p>For more than four years he was held in CIA black sites in Thailand and Poland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/10/guantanamo-detainee-abu-zubaydah-cia-torture-hearing\">subjected to some of the most brutal torture ever carried out by the US state</a>.

Though the case has no bearing on Zubaydahâ€™s habeas petition, observers were struck by the fact that for the first time supreme court justices directly referred to what he endured as â€œtortureâ€.</p> <p>Several of the justices also expressed astonishment that Zubaydah was still in GuantÃ¡namo without charge despite clear supreme court rulings that prohibit such indefinite detention.

But the high court confirmed the application had been filed.</p> <p>The governmentâ€™s actions drew immediate condemnation from human rights lawyers.</p> <p>Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer Kieran Pender said it was another â€œperverse turnâ€ in the governmentâ€™s pursuit of secrecy in the prosecution.</p> <p>â€œThe Attorney-Generalâ€™s attempts to have a decision that said no to secrecy itself be kept secret is not only absurd but undemocratic,â€ he told the Guardian.</p> <p>â€œRather than seeking to shroud this prosecution in secrecy at every turn, the Morrison Government should be reforming the law â€“ like it promised to do 12 months ago â€“ so that whistleblowers who speak up are protected, not punished.â€</p> <p>Collaery, a barrister, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/30/canberra-secret-hearing-collaery-witness-k-anger-simmers-timor-bugging-hearing\">facing trial</a> for his alleged role in revealing a 2004 bugging operation Australia mounted against Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste claims the operation was designed to give it an advantage during negotiations with the impoverished and fledgling nation over oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea.</p> <p>At the same time as it seeks a high court hearing to redact the judgement, the Commonwealth is also seeking to put new secret evidence before a judge, which Collaery cannot see, to justify the need for secrecy in his trial.</p> <p>That evidence would only be available to the judge, and would tell him that the national security situation and Australiaâ€™s international relations in the past two years, as Collaeryâ€™s trial has dragged on.</p> <p>The evidence would force the court to again decide whether, on balance, Collaeryâ€™s trial may need to be partly heard in secret.</p> <p>Earlier on Friday in the ACT supreme court, Collaeryâ€™s lawyers said that would cause â€œirreparableâ€ and â€œobviousâ€ unfairness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/10/governments-secret-evidence-against-bernard-collaery-could-lead-to-perpetual-vortex-of-delay-judge-warns\">Governmentâ€™s secret evidence against Bernard Collaery could lead to â€˜perpetual vortexâ€™ of delay, judge warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>â€œThe unfairness is obvious and it is irreparable,â€ Collaeryâ€™s barrister, Christopher Ward SC, told the court. â€œIt is an irreparable prejudice. The unfairness is that the commonwealth gets to update evidence ... as to world events, as to the current state of asserted threats to national security in the way that the defendant is simply unable to respond to.â€</p> <p>The court heard that much has changed for Australiaâ€™s international relations in the 18 months since the case began, including, for example, the dispute with France over the submarines contract, the resignation of Christian Porter as attorney general, and the Brereton inquiry report into alleged special forces war crimes in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Ward warned of an â€œendless processâ€ in which delays to the case allowed the commonwealth a continuous ability to say the world had changed, and that new factors ought to be taken into account when determining the national security risk of the trial.</p> <p>But Jeremy Kirk SC, representing the attorney general, said the commonwealth was simply trying to update the evidence, now two years old, on the potential national security ramifications, not reopen the original hearing on how much of the trial should be conducted in secret.</p> <p>Kirk said it would be absurd to not allow such evidence to be updated and dismissed the suggestion it would lead to an endless process of delay and updating evidence.</p> <p>The unfairness, he said, would be towards the attorney general and the national security interests of Australia, should the commonwealth not be permitted to update the evidence.</p> <p>â€œThat is a bit of an unreal submission, in our respectful submission ... this evidence is 18 months to two yers old,â€ he said.</p> <p>Justice David Mossop has reserved his decision on whether to accept the new evidence.

We are facing challenges including rapid military modernisation, tension over territorial claims, heightened economic coercion, undermining of international law, including the law of the sea, through to enhanced disinformation, foreign interference and cyber threats, enabled by new and emerging technologies. <strong>In the discussions I have with our like-minded friends in the region, the message comes through loud and clear: They share our interest in ensuring continued peace and prosperity</strong>. They want to see the Indo-Pacific Operating System characterised by order and stability.â€</p> \n  <p>(This language about the complex environment largely echoes last yearâ€™s defence strategic update.)</p> \n  <p>Dutton says the Aukus deal with the US and the UK is about â€œmore than submarinesâ€, given that it also covers cyber, quantum and AI cooperation. He says it will â€œenable deeper practical cooperation in developing leading-edge military capabilities and technologiesâ€ - which will help to ensure Australia â€œremains a responsible and highly capable security partner in the Indo-Pacific region for decades to comeâ€.</p> \n  <p>But implicitly rejecting the criticism that some (including China) have made of Aukus as a retreat into the Anglosphere, Dutton says Aukus is just one example of a broader deepening of Australiaâ€™s partnerships with others in the region. He argues the strength and durability of some partnerships are â€œoften underestimated and their development as defence security partnerships often overlookedâ€. He cites Australiaâ€™s relationship with Japan, saying their soon-to-be-finalised reciprocal access agreement will pave the way for joint exercises and disaster relief operations between the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the Australian Defence Force.</p> \n  <p>Dutton says Australia wants to be seen across the Indo-Pacific region as a strong and reliable partner â€œthat more than lifts its weight in securing peace in our regionâ€. He says the Coalition has lifted defence spending to above 2% of GDP â€œbecause thatâ€™s whatâ€™s required to equip the Australian Defence Force with the kit it needs and to keep Australia safe and secureâ€.</p> \n  <p>He says Australia is maintaining investment in its core military capabilities and continuing to develop new ones â€œto hold a potential adversaryâ€™s forces and infrastructure at risk from a greater distance, capabilities which send a clear deterrent message to any adversary that the cost they would incur in threatening our interests outweighs the benefits of so doingâ€.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T07:04:08.560Z\">at 7.04am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-61a719458f08ad7893e727e2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T06:42:49.039Z\">6.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Queensland records new Covid case</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A Covid case has been detected on the Gold Coast.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AnnastaciaMP/status/1465934045435494406\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: New case of COVID-19 detected in Queensland.

Some people spend long political careers working incredibly hard but nevertheless remaining distant from the great responsibility and honour of being in a ministry or representing their Nation in its Cabinet.</p> \n  <p>In the years since 2008 I have been deeply fortunate to spend 11 years in ministries and only a few months in opposition.</p> \n  <p>It has been a remarkable privilege to have been a State Attorney General and State Treasurer in Western Australia and to have been the Commonwealth Minister for Social Services, Industry, Science and Technology and serve as Commonwealth Attorney General and Industrial Relations Minister and Leader of the House of Representatives.</p> \n  <p>Looking back at my time as a Minister the trust that was placed in me by Premier Colin Barnett and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, meant that for much of my time in Cabinet I was entrusted with multiple senior portfolios at once. That was a challenge that I always gave everything to and when working for the Australian public in these roles I never left anything in the tank.</p> \n  <p>When you are an obsessive compulsive type and entrusted with work that you believe in and that you believe is deeply important, the by-product becomes that people in your life that deserve more from you, especially your family, get much less than they deserve.</p> \n  <p>My little boy was born one day before I first became a Commonwealth Minister.</p> \n  <p>He and his little sister have never known anything but their fatherâ€™s regular absence and so the next part of my working life will be anchored around being close to them and being there for them.</p> \n  <p>There are few, if any, constants left in modern politics. Perhaps the only certainty now is that there appears to be no limit to what some will say or allege or do to gain an advantage over a perceived enemy.</p> \n  <p>This makes the harshness that can accompany the privilege of representing people, harder than ever before.</p> \n  <p>But even though I have experienced perhaps more of the harshness of modern politics than most, there are no regrets. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"071af48ba438eb82ea8fbd1fad6aa77704443475\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/071af48ba438eb82ea8fbd1fad6aa77704443475/0_42_3360_2017/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The member for Pearce Christian Porter during question time in the house of representatives, Parliament House, Canberra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The member for Pearce, Christian Porter, during question time in the House of Representatives, Parliament House, Canberra.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It has been the experience of a lifetime to work with great teams of men and women to drive change and to govern during remarkable times, including the most demanding time for Government since WWII.</p> \n  <p>I feel that not a moment of the last 14 years was wasted and I am thankful for the opportunity and friendship provided by my Parliamentary colleagues and the men and women of the Liberal Party.</p> \n  <p>I am forever grateful for the support of my family, friends and the dedication of staff (some who started with me 20 years ago).</p> \n  <p>Ultimately, it has always started and finished with the people of my electorate. I started with the promise to fix the GST for the people of my electorate and while it took years I was part of the small group in Federal Cabinet that made it happen for WA. Since 2013 I have been dedicated to securing critical funding for projects that had been long neglected and would improve the lives of people in our local community.</p> \n  <p>This included hundreds of millions of dollars to extend and widen the Mitchell Freeway, over a billion dollars to fund the Yanchep and Ellenbrook rail lines, completion of the $1 billion Northlink project (WAâ€™s biggest ever road project), the Beverley Cornerstone project, the Northam Aquatic Centre and the Toodyay Sport and Recreation Precinct just to name a few.</p> \n  <p>Before each election I have always asked myself whether I could absolutely guarantee another three years of total commitment to the electorate because people deserve that commitment, free of any reservations.</p> \n  <p>After a long time giving everything I could to the people of Pearce itâ€™s now time to give more of what is left to those around me whose love has been unconditional. The Federal Liberal Party have done great things for the electorate of Pearce and I know a new Liberal candidate can continue the trusted record of serving the needs of the electorate under a re-elected Coalition Government.</p> \n  <p>The Hon Christian Porter MP</p> \n  <p>Federal Member for Pearce</p> \n  <p>1 December 2021 </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T05:29:42.271Z\">at 5.29am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-61a704258f08ad7893e72706\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T05:16:14.714Z\">5.16am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Back to <strong>Amanda Stoker</strong>, and we are getting a new straw man argument for the governmentâ€™s voter ID laws; just because there are not a lot prosecutions, doesnâ€™t mean there isnâ€™t a problem, is what Stoker is arguing on the (yet to be proven or explained) need to show ID before voting.

It is fair minded and anyone whoâ€™s serious about the integrity of Australian elections should have no problem with this bill. But that said, we do what we need to do to get stuff done.</p> \n   <p>...The fact there hasnâ€™t been prosecutions doesnâ€™t mean there isnâ€™t a problem. All it means is that the problem that we are trying to deal with is one that isnâ€™t being captured by the things we currently measure. </p> \n   <p>But ultimately letâ€™s go back to the essence of it here. All Australians have some form of ID. The list of ways you can identify yourself is extraordinarily long. And in circumstances where there is no exclusion of any Australian as a consequence of the requirement to show ID, then having better accountability around double voting or people who have since passed voting is something that is in everyoneâ€™s interest, particularly when seats can often turn by double digits.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"122aa1332a626a35fbb5cd486edbf951a537cda6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/122aa1332a626a35fbb5cd486edbf951a537cda6/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Queensland senator Amanda Stoker.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queensland senator Amanda Stoker.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T06:06:28.132Z\">at 6.06am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-61a703ff8f08ab53167b7d15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T05:11:58.169Z\">5.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Over in the senate Larissa Waters is giving notice that she will be moving this motion:</p> \n  <p>I give notice that on the next day of sitting, I shall moveâ€”That:<br><br></p> \n  <p>a) the Minister representing the Prime Minister attend the Senate at 12pm on the first sitting day of 2022 to provide an explanation of the Governmentâ€™s response to the Australian Human Rights Commission report, Set the Standard: Report on the Independent Review into Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces, including implementation of the recommendations in the report; and</p> \n  <p>b) any senator may move to take note of the explanation required by paragraph (a); and</p> \n  <p>c) any motion under paragraph (b) may be debated for no more than 60 minutes, and senators may speak to the motion for no more than 10 minutes each. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-61a703408f089b5900e7fb2e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T05:10:39.287Z\">5.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The minister assisting the attorney general, Queensland senator <strong>Amanda Stoker </strong>has been asked on the ABC whether the government will be adopting all 28 recommendations in the <strong>Kate Jenkins</strong> report (as Jenkins wants).</p> \n  <p>The short version is â€“ TBA.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Itâ€™s something that the government is very seriously considering.

give his speech, without anyone shutting it down â€“ that seems part of a strategy to a) not make him a martyr and give more attention to anti-vaxxer causes and b) because some members of the government donâ€™t want to scare too many of those voters completely out of the â€œtentâ€.</p> \n  <p>So the motion was held and at least two government MPs crossed the floor to vote with Kelly: </p>

It is an extraordinary world first, and a scheme no other country in the world has tried to put together, and the timeframe and in the way that collectively we have done it, over 470,000 participants, with permanent and significant disability, a social insurance scheme that every Australian can rely on, a scheme that enjoys the support of everyone in the House. </p> \n   <p>A scheme whereby Australians find themselves in difficulty, they know there is a social insurance policy there to assist them. The issues of this particular case will certainly be looked into by the minister and the department because with over 470,000 Australians being cared for ... there are always opportunities to improve and to look at particular matters.</p> \n   <p>The Morrison government is behind the NDIS and built the NDIS, the Morrison government finalised agreements with the states and continues to work cooperatively and collaboratively towards.

A stronger recovery than we have seen in the <strong>UK</strong>, a stronger recovery than we have seen in <strong>Canada</strong>, a stronger recovery than we have seen in <strong>Germany</strong>, stronger recovery than we have seen in <strong>Italy</strong>, and a stronger recovery than we have seen in <strong>Japan.</strong> </p> \n   <p>And the credit is due to the Australian people. To the hard work of 26 million Australians. They have faced the biggest economic shock since the great depression ... the first pandemic in a century, and we all remember those images last year, last March, of thousands of our fellow Australians lining up outside <strong>Centrelink</strong>, either having lost their jobs, and businesses were fearful of losing not only their business but also their homes. </p> \n   <p>And the <strong>Morrison government</strong> responded with the strongest economic support this country has ever seen! Around $300m of economic support, more than all the states and territories put together. Programs like <strong>jobkeeper</strong> that saved 700,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, and the cash flow boost in the business and support payments, pensioners and carers and veterans and others on income support. </p> \n   <p>So today the national accounts see business investment 9.1% higher through the year. In programs like <strong>homebuilder</strong> which was ridiculed by those opposite, but together with our other policies have seen 320,000 Australians get into a home over the last three years. We saw in the national accounts today, we saw dwelling investment up in the national accounts and dwelling investment is 11.4% higher through the year. </p> \n   <p>And all that time we are providing economic support to Australians, what else are we doing, something those opposite would never do, providing tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts Australians have ever seen. Taxes cuts for families, tax cuts for small business and business investment incentives. </p> \n   <p>While those opposite took $387bn of higher taxes to the Australian people, we have been supporting them with lower taxes, income, and business support and the net result is that unemployment today is lower than when we came to government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T03:15:37.157Z\">at 3.15am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-61a6e54c8f08ab53167b7bd9\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T03:01:01.464Z\">3.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Question time begins</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>And the second-last question time of the year has begun, with treasurer <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> on his feet, coming in hot. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T03:10:45.845Z\">at 3.10am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-61a6e3b08f08ab53167b7bce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T03:00:22.513Z\">3.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labor has done a deal to pass the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/25/senate-scuttles-coalition-crackdown-on-charity-advocacy-work\">political campaigner bill</a>, with amendments, and has secured agreement from the government to drop the voter ID bill, which will now not be voted on before the 2022 election.</p> \n  <p>Labor confirmed it did a deal to increase the threshold at which organisations such as charities have to declare electoral spending.</p> \n  <p>The crossbench believes the deal includes:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>A threshold of $250,000 (up from $100,000)</li> \n   <li>A new name of political campaigner, now to be called â€œlarge third party campaignersâ€; and</li> \n   <li>Shifting liability from organisation officials, such as a secretary, for breaches of disclosure requirements to the entity itself.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The deal is of great concern to the charity sector, which opposes the bill due to the expanded definition of electoral expenditure and the retrospective effect of the bill.</p> \n  <p><strong>Senator Stirling Griff </strong>told Guardian Australia he â€œnever would have supportedâ€ the bill if retrospectivity stayed in, so he believes the deal was unnecessary. </p> \n  <p>Labor claims that Griff, <strong>Jacqui Lambie </strong>and <strong>Rex Patrick </strong>would not commit to block the bill, so theyâ€™ve secured a watered down bill in the face of it possibly passing unamended.</p> \n  <p>But the voter ID bill seems dead and buried.

Household spending in these three jurisdictions fell 8.4% compared with a 0.7% rise for the rest of Australia, the ABS said.</p> \n  <p>And thank the governments for increasing their spending to keep the economy ticking along.</p> \n  <p>Private demand lopped 2.4 percentage points from GDP growth, which was partly offset by public outlays that cushioned some of the drop, adding 0.7 percentage points to growth.</p> \n  <p>The record current account surplus nudging $23.9bn also did some heaving lifting, adding 1 full percentage point to the growth. Thank some high energy prices for much of that result. </p> \n  <p>Economists, you may recall, were all geared up to â€œlook throughâ€ this GDP drop because the focus is on a rebounding economy in the December quarter. </p> \n  <p>The fact the drop of 1.9% was significantly better than the expected 2.5-3% fall will worry some, though, that we now run a risk of excessive economic exuberance since public spending continues to be strong.</p> \n  <p>And those households that were locked down are loaded with cash. The ratio of household savings jumped to 19.8% in the September quarter from 11.8% in the June quarters.</p> \n  <p>Also, household gross disposable income rose 4.6%, the fastest rise since December quarter 2008, the ABS said.<br></p> \n  <p>Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s that risk of an overshoot in the quarters to come - unless Omicron or other Covid variants spoil the party. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T01:18:32.244Z\">at 1.18am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-61a6c9b28f08ab53167b7ab8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2021-12-01T01:03:33.371Z\">1.03am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Albo's got a unicorn, I've brought the GraviTrax': MPs give to Christmas appeal</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Scott Morrison </strong>made some remarks at the launch of the Wishing Tree Appeal in his office.

I think Australians are coming together for Christmas and thatâ€™s really exciting. I think weâ€™re looking forward to this Christmas, like few up until now, and this weekend Iâ€™m putting the lights up on the house. Iâ€™m looking forward to that and the ritual with the girls and with Jen, and Iâ€™m wishing everybody here a Merry Christmas.

That got me through quite a few lockdowns this year, Iâ€™ve got to tell you, as others went through puzzles and various other things.</p> \n   <p>So the other thing Iâ€™m looking forward to, I think itâ€™s going to be a bumper Christmas for our retailers who have been doing it really tough. <strong>So when youâ€™re out shopping for Christmas, shop local, support your local small businesses, theyâ€™ve had a tough year.</strong> So why not give them a great Christmas present by doing your local shopping in your local shops, supporting the local businesses who stood by you during the course of this pandemic. And itâ€™d be great to see them also having a bumper Christmas and as their staff are coming back and also looking forward to that great period of time.</p> \n   <p> But Christmas is an important Christian religious festival as well, and something thatâ€™s very important I know to so many Australians and it is a great time of family and coming together. But for those of the Christian faith, it is a very important time of the year and we celebrate the birth of Christ. So enjoy the season and wishing everybody a very merry Christmas.

So, when it comes to this issue, weâ€™ve got a strong track record of standing up to those who would threaten Australian safety. And, frankly, itâ€™s not just there. To those who would seek to coerce us in the region, weâ€™ll stand up to them. </p> \n   <p>As treasurer I stood up to the big banks, as treasurer we stood up, and as prime minister, to the big energy companies.

Repeatedly, politicians from local, state and federal ranks have acted without integrity and contributed to the ongoing and deteriorating perception of the body politic.</p> \n   <p>In any survey about the most trusted professions in our society, politicians usually rank amongst the lowest, and why wouldnâ€™t this be the case, given the continued exposure of questionable activities over the years? <strong>Whether itâ€™s alleged lies in election campaigns, dodgy preselections, misappropriation of public monies, personal benefits resulting from insider information, monies sequestered in overseas tax havens, abuse of office for personal advantage, dodgy land deals or connections with foreign governments, the list goes on and on.</strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Negative public perceptions are compounded when politicians dig their heels in, spin the story and fail to take responsibility for their actions.</strong> They rely on the fast-moving media cycle and wait for the next story to take over the front page, and this frustrates the public even more. Modern democracies and the operation of open government must be accountable and transparent, thereby obviating any suspicion of skulduggery.</p> \n   <p><strong>In conclusion, those who resist the introduction of an effective federal integrity body raise peopleâ€™s curiosity. One has to ask the question: are they conflicted?</strong> Why are they resisting the implementation of such a body? And when we speak of integrity, Iâ€™m once again reminded of the words of <strong>Marcus Aurelius,</strong> Roman emperor and philosopher: â€œIf it is not right, do not do it.

arrangements for a charter flight, amid concerns pandemic border rules were slowing arrivals of Afghan nationals to Australia in the weeks leading up to the Talibanâ€™s takeover.</p> <p>The

of this government doing too little, too late,â€ Laborâ€™s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-document\"

Australia suddenly closes Kabul embassy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The home affairs department said at the time there were â€œongoing challenges to the processing of humanitarian program applications, including Afghan LEE applicationsâ€.</p> <p>Those challenges included â€œcontinuing restrictions on the departmentâ€™s offshore activities and those of our partner agencies due to Covid-19, for example an inability to conduct medical assessmentsâ€.</p> <p>â€œThis, combined with the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, makes it extremely difficult to not only process visas but

arriving and transiting passengers from Afghanistanâ€. </p> <p>â€œWith the suspension of flights to the UAE, commercial flights will become very limited,â€ the submission said.</p> <p>â€œThe

other countries where they may seek resettlement and engage with UNHCRâ€.</p> <p>Hawke was briefed on rigidities in the existing LEE scheme, including that relatives are â€œoften refused as they are not found to be dependent on the primary applicantâ€. A single parent of an Afghan employee was eligible but married parents were not.</p> <p>The government was considering options to broaden the eligibility for the LEE scheme, with officials noting former employees were attracting â€œsignificant support from advocate groups including former Defence personnelâ€.</p> <p>Home affairs officials said an increased intake â€œshould be manageable within the current budgetâ€, but also warned of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/18/peter-dutton-suggests-some-former-afghan-guards-and-interpreters-could-pose-security-risk-to-australia\">increased security risks</a> if the pool was widened.</p> <p>â€œIf the cohort is expanded, the security risk would increase and therefore a deeper investigation would be required to ensure that visa applicants satisfy security and character requirements,â€ the 12 July document said.</p> <h2>Governor general seeks briefing</h2> <p>Ten days later, Hawke received another brief from home affairs to prepare him for a meeting with the governor general.</p> <p>Hurley, who serves as the Queenâ€™s representative in Australia but is a former defence force chief, requested a briefing about the Afghan LEE program. Hawke briefed him on 23 July.</p> <p>â€œThe governor general sought the briefing because of his interest in the program and professional connection to Australiaâ€™s mission in Afghanistan,â€ a spokesperson for Hurley told Guardian Australia. â€œHe was grateful to the minister and government for the briefing.â€</p> <p>At the time of the briefing, Australia had granted more than 1,600 visas to Afghan LEEs and their family members since the program began in 2013, and there were a further 76 applications on hand â€“ covering 369 people.</p> <p>But home affairs told Hawke the â€œmain visa processing impedimentâ€ was that most of these people were awaiting mandatory health examinations by the International Organisation for Migration in Kabul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e205db8769fcf6943ebcb70616cb9b5d338978a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e205db8769fcf6943ebcb70616cb9b5d338978a/0_246_5167_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laborâ€™s foreign affairs spokesperson Penny Wong says â€˜veterans and former prime ministers were calling on the prime minister to act for monthsâ€™.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laborâ€™s foreign affairs spokesperson Penny Wong says â€˜veterans and former prime ministers were calling on the prime minister to act for monthsâ€™.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The same document added: â€œThe ministers for Defence and foreign affairs need to finalise any additional certifications as soon as possible to enable the LEE to lodge visa applications in a timely fashion so that home affairs officers in Amman can finalise the visa processing.â€</p> <p>That is because the program requires the employing minister to certify the applicant is at significant individual risk of harm because of their support to the Australian mission in Afghanistan, before home affairs formally issues the visa.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/06/adf-chief-surprised-by-speed-of-afghanistans-cascade-collapse-to-the-taliban\">Australian defence force chief surprised by speed of Afghanistanâ€™s â€˜cascade collapseâ€™ to the Taliban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As of 22 July, Defence and home affairs expected a further 49 former employees to be certified, meaning an extra 250 visa applicants.</p> <p>Officials said tighter quarantine caps had seen â€œarrivals and bookings reduced to less than five passengers per dayâ€ â€“ but the NSW government â€œindicated an additional 100 seats can be made available from late July to early August for humanitarian entrantsâ€.</p> <h2>Wong says Hawke â€˜ignored warningsâ€™</h2> <p>Despite the earlier reluctance to charter flights, the 22 July brief shows Dfat and the health department were by that point â€œprogressing arrangements for a charter flight to transport up to 200 Afghan LEE and their families to Australia via the Howard Springs quarantine facilityâ€.</p> <p>The flight was â€œexpected to arrive on 30 August 2021â€.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/17/australia-will-not-be-able-to-rescue-all-afghans-who-served-alongside-military-scott-morrison-says\">Australia will not be able to rescue all Afghans who served alongside military, Scott Morrison says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that plan was overtaken by events, with the fall of Kabul to the Taliban in the middle of August prompting Australia and its allies to launch a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/27/australian-soldiers-ended-afghanistan-evacuation-mission-before-kabul-attacks\">high-risk military-led evacuation effort</a>.</p> <p>The Australian defence force flew 4,168 evacuees out of Kabul, including 2,984 Afghans with visas. The government offered emergency visas to applicants who had applied for the LEE program but were not certified â€“ a move triggered by the practical challenges with visa processing in Afghanistan at that time.</p> <p>Officials argue the government rapidly adapted its response to include one of Australiaâ€™s largest humanitarian airlift operations. The documents show a gradual increase in visas granted to Afghan LEEs between February and July 2021, before the security situation in Afghanistan quickly deteriorated in August.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Hawke said on Tuesday: â€œThe government has successfully evacuated more than 4,000 Afghan Locally Engaged Employees and their families to Australia since 2013. This is in addition to more than 10,000 Afghans that Australia has granted permanent protection in that time.â€</p> <p>But Labor said the documents showed â€œtragicâ€ delays. â€œVeterans and former prime ministers were calling on the prime minister to act for months,â€ Wong said.</p> <p>â€œMinister Hawke ignored warnings from his own department that commercial flights would become very limited. Days later he was telling journalists that Australia would not join the US airlift, and had â€˜no planâ€™ to mount a similar operation.â€</p> <p>Comment was also sought from the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the defence minister, Peter Dutton.</p>",
